## üß† Algorithms

The solver supports different strategies:

- **Greedy** ‚Äî Fast & simple, chooses best immediate score.
- **Mobility** ‚Äî Prefers moves that keep future placement options open.
- **Beam Search** ‚Äî Looks ahead multiple steps, prunes worst boards.
- (Pluggable ‚Äî you can add your own in `src/lib/solver`.)

You can change the algorithm in the UI.
